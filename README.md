# Pong-Using-My-Graphics-Engine
A simple representation of Pong using my C++ Graphics Engine

# How to Play

The player I is controlled with the W (for up), S (for down) and SPACE (for a speed increase).
The player II is controlled with the UP-ARROW, DOWN-ARROW and the RIGHT-ARROW.

The game ends when one of the players gain 10 points, the points are displayed on each player's side.

# How to Run

To run the code it's required to compile using MSVC and its necesssary to link my library (cwin32.lib) as well as user32.lib and d2d1.lib (Not sure about the last 2 ones).
